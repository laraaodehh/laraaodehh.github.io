            <p>
                Vertical wind turbines are a type of wind turbine where the main rotor shaft is set
                vertically, and the main components are located at the base of the turbine. Unlike
                horizontal wind turbines, vertical turbines can capture wind from any direction without
                the need to adjust their position.

            <h2>Horizontal Wind Turbines</h2>
            <p>
                Horizontal wind turbines have blades that rotate around a horizontal axis, and they need
                to face the direction of the wind to operate efficiently. These turbines are more common
                and widely used in wind farms around the world.
